<p>Typically we only host students who can work with us for 6 months or more in 2 sessions. Session 1: Jan-June, Session 2: Jul-&gt;Dec each year. During covid (it will be remote), and if NTU allows student to come to Singapore, we will prefer you to be physically in our lab. Currently we only host students who are doing this as part of their course sanctioned by their school and its graded *so its not a personal arrangement*.</p>
