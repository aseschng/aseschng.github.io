<p>Typically we only host students who can work with us for 6 months or more in 2 sessions. Session 1: Jan-June, Session 2: Jul-&gt;Dec each year. Since covid (it had been remote). Currently we only host students who are doing this as part of their course sanctioned by their school and its graded *so its not a personal arrangement*.</p>
