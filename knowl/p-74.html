<p>You will need to meet up with your TAC yearly. TAC members are there to help your progress in your PhD journey and to sign off the TAC report. Hence, for their evaluation, arrange for a meeting with them individually or together yearly. Depending on their availability/request, you can meet you physically to report, or just send them your slides as update, and/or record a 20~30 mins presentation for update as video for their verification.</p>
